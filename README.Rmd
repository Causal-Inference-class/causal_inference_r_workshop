### Installing materials locally

We will be using RStudio Cloud for the workshop, but if you would like to install the required packages and course materials, we have an R package called {[causalworkshop](https://github.com/malcolmbarrett/causalworkshop)} to help you do that! You can install {[causalworkshop](https://github.com/malcolmbarrett/causalworkshop)} from GitHub with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("malcolmbarrett/causalworkshop")
```

Once you've installed the package, install the workshop with

``` r
causalworkshop::install_workshop()
```

By default, this package downloads the materials to a conspicuous place like your Desktop. You can also tell `install_workshop()` exactly where to put the materials:

``` r
causalworkshop::install_workshop("a/path/on/your/computer")
```
