## When you have no confounders and there is a linear relationship between the exposure and the outcome, that *correlation is a causal relationship*

# Even in these cases, using the methods you will learn here can help!

1. Adjusting for baseline confounders can make an estimate *more efficient*

--

1. Propensity score weighting is *more efficient* that direct adjustment
--

1. Sometimes we are *more comfortable with the functional form of the propensity score* (predicting exposure) than the outcome model
