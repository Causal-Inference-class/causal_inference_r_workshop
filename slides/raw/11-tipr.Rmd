## Recall: Propensity scores

Rosenbaum and Rubin showed in observational studies, conditioning on **propensity scores** can lead to unbiased estimates of the exposure effect

1. There are no unmeasured confounders
2. Every subject has a nonzero probability of receiving either exposure

## Example

*Our causal effect estimate: **3.5 kg (95% CI 2.4 kg, 4.4 kg)***

--

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(tipr)
tip_coef(effect = 2.4,
         smd = 0.3)
```

--

The observed effect (2.4, 4.4) WOULD be tipped by 1 unmeasured confounder
with the following specifications:

*estimated standardized mean difference between the unmeasured confounder
in the exposed population and unexposed population: 0.3*  

*estimated association between the unmeasured confounder and the outcome: 8*

## Your turn

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 10)`

1. Use the `tip_coef()` function to conduct a sensitivity analysis for the estimate from your previous exercises.
